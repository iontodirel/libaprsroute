## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in reporting it responsibly.

To report a security vulnerability, please use the **[GitHub private vulnerability reporting tool](../../security/advisories/new)**.

This allows you to submit issues privately to the maintainers. You can expect a response within **5 business days**, and we aim to provide a fix or mitigation within **30 days** of confirmation.

We appreciate responsible disclosure and thank you for helping keep our project secure!
